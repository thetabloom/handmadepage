	<h2>A woman dedicated to humanity.</h2>
  <div class="intro column">
<p class="content-box">Intro. Our family tried to reconnect at the funeral, and shortly before that at her 90th birthday celebration.
Two reunion’s back to back.
The entire Wilhite, and extended clans gathered in the tiny town of Larned Kansas.
Larned has brick streets, an olympic sized swimming pool, a mental hospital, and smells like cow shit. It has no real future for the kids that grow up there. It’s not like it was when I was a kid.
Not like it used to be when Grandmas kids were young.
We unloaded our suitcases into the only hotel that didn’t have someone smoking behind the register, and headed to the funeral home.
<i>The pastor decided he’d provide the eulogy last minute, on a Sunday. 
He kept calling Grandma, Thelma Marie.</i> 
She was cremated and buried with Michelle, her cat.

<div class= "second column"><p class="exerpt">My grandma had quite a bit of knowledge in organic farming. She used that cow shit to fertilize her plants. She taught me about Victory Gardens. I remember being out in he yard for hours upon hours inspecting every single plant and asking questions about how they grow. She grafted fruit trees to each other. One had peaches and pears on the same tree! Pretty much everything we ate was out of her garden or from a local producer. I didn't know how lucky I was at the time, but I sure did soak up every bit of wisdom I could squeeze out of her.
